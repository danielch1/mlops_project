Image Classification using the TIMM Framework

[Data Set LEGO Minifigures](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ihelon/lego-minifigures-classification) from Kaggle

it contains images of different Lego Minifigures with numeric labels. The figures are from 4 different popular LEGO Themes: 
- LEGO Harry Potter
- LEGO Jurassic World
- LEGO Marvel
- LEGO Star Wars

One Class is one kind of Figure (like Boba Fett, Obi Wan or Harry Potter). The Images feature the figures in the different positions and holding differnt items in some cases. We will base the Machine Learning Code on the Deep Learning Frame Work PyTorch. For the image recognition we will use the timm library which is based on PyTorch. timm is a library containing state of the art computer vision models, layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders, augmentations, and training/evaluation scripts for image augmentation tasks.

The Data will be stored in a dvc repository. Running the setup will automatically pull the data to the machine from the google Drive. 


Frameworks for MLops:

Version Control for Data --> DVC (Store Data on Gdrive) x
Code Typing? x
Run Training in Docker x
Use Hydra for configuration and hyperparameter Management x
Maybe Hyperparameter Tuning via wandb Sweep x
(Use Pytorch-Lightning for Training)
Use wandb for to log the training Process x
